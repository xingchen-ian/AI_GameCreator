# First Playable Web Game Brief

> This summary and the accompanying system graph are the two primary development references. Build from both. If they conflict, preserve the learning goal and ask the student before changing the core design.

## 1. Project Identity
- Student / Team: 
- Project Title: 
- Domain: 
- Tool / AI Agent: 

## 2. Design Summary
**Domain and real experience:** boil an egg

this is a everyday thing. Most of the Chinese got a time when they need to boil an egg as breakfast

**Novice misconception:** they don't know how to observe the doneness if they forge to time it. They also don't know how to adjust the time needed according to how big the egg is

**Most important domain challenge:** Knowing the time by observing the water or sound etc.

they may takeout the egg early or late

**Core learning shift:** from simply counting the time in mind or relying on users' feeling to observe how the water boils, how the egg moves and the sound of boiling

## 3. Core Player Learning Loop
**Observe:** observe how the water boils, how strong the egg moves and the sound of boiling, how large and small is the egg, how high the power of the pot is

**Judge:** observe how the water boils, how the egg moves and the sound of boiling, also how large and small is the egg, how high the power of the pot is

**Act:** put the egg in the pot , adjust the power of pot, get the egg out

**Read feedback:** if the boil a egg that perfectly meets customers' desire, reward 5 coins, if it's okay,3 coins, if it's far away from what the customers want, coins will be deducted

**Adjust:** if overcooked, take less time or turn down the power, if it's too raw, take more time or turn up the power

**Ability improved through repetition:** observing the condition and control the time, also they could play faster by controlling the power of pot

## 4. Data Model for the System Graph

### Environment Data
- observe how the water boils, how strong the egg moves and the sound of boiling, how large and small is the egg, how high the power of the pot is

### Player-Controlled Data
- put the egg in the pot , adjust the power of pot, get the egg out

### System-Calculated Results
- if the boil a egg that perfectly meets customers' desire, reward 5 coins, if it's okay,3 coins, if it's far away from what the customers want, coins will be deducted

### Feedback Translation
- how the water boils, if it's boling a bit it's not done yet, maybe its from raw to soft boiled. if the water boils strongly, it would be soft boiled to half done. If it evaporates for a longtime it would be overcooked
- the movement of the egg, when it start to turn around in the pot,it's soft boiled, if it turns rapidly and violently, it's well done, and when it last for a longtime it would be overcooked
- the sound of the water, from low to loud shows how long it boils

## 5. Challenge Space
**Challenge factors (affecting player-controlled data):** when will the egg step into different status ← how large the egg is, the heat level , when it is taken out

**Factors that force a new judgment:** the heat level and the size of egg and the desired doneness, the waiting time customers can endure may change the heat level and speed user choose

**Perceivable vs inferred factors:** time need to be infered, and size and heat can be observed

**Challenge dimension table:** easy: every customers can wait for relatively long time, and the size of eggs are all around medium
hard: customers waiting time changes and the size of egg and the desired doneness varies largely

**2-3 progressive challenge combinations:** Not specified yet.

**Simple-to-complex sequence:** no

**What failure teaches next:** yes, they know they are overcooked or undercooked so they know how to adjust time and heat level

## 6. Visual & Camera
**Camera perspective:** first person

**Why this perspective fits the learning shift:** because we just experience the action of boiling eggs

**2D / 2.5D / 3D:** 2d

**Visual style:** hand-drawn

**Color tone:** bright and warm, it's a warm and cute game

**Sound:** cute music, evaporating sound

## 7. AI Collaboration Boundary
**Student-owned decisions (AI must not change):** core mechanic, learning shift, win/lose conditions, core variables.

**AI-autonomous decisions:** technical implementation, code structure, visual polish.

**How to detect and pull back a generic game:** Not specified yet.

## 8. Rules, Boundaries, and Outcomes
**Important states:** different states of the boiling egg  and the desire doneness of the egg

**How player actions change the system:** turn down and turn up the heat, boil it for longer or shorter time

**Success condition:** the time and the heat resulting in a status that is not far away from the desired status

**Failure conditions:** boil an egg that is far away from the desired doneness, or letting the customers wait for too long

**Just-right ranges and thresholds:** yes, there could be about 6 doneness level, and +-1 level of the desired level is acceptable

## 9. Feedback Priorities
**Immediate feedback:** a little sound

**Feedback discovered over time:** the water boils and evaporate

**Feedback that must be visual, spatial, audible, or state-based:** all these three are visuals and sound

## 10. First Playable Version Scope
- Build a small desktop-browser game that validates one complete observe → judge → act → feedback → adjust loop.
- Use the accompanying system graph to implement 2-3 challenge presets when they are clearly defined. Each challenge should change system variables or relationships, not only visual decoration.
- Keep graphics simple and readable. Prioritize interaction, feedback, and learning over polish.
- Do not add realistic simulation, complex menus, accounts, online multiplayer, large asset pipelines, or unrelated features in the first version.
- Do not convert the project into a generic mini-game that only uses the domain as a theme.

## 11. Web Game Technical Dependencies and GitHub Pages

This project is published as a GitHub Pages site. The published site IS the exhibition. There is no ZIP packaging step and no separate offline build.

### GitHub Pages Publishing Rules
- The site is served from the repository root on the `main` branch, at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
- Because GitHub Pages serves the site from a subpath, **every internal link and every asset path must be relative**. Root-absolute paths beginning with `/` will break on the published site even when they work locally.
- Store all required models, textures, audio, fonts, and libraries inside the repository. Do not load them from a CDN or another remote service.
- The repository is public. Never commit passwords, tokens, API keys, or personal information the student has not agreed to publish.
- After every push, the site republishes automatically. Verify the live URL, not only the local server.

### Choose the Lowest Necessary Dependency Track
1. **Track A - No build step:** Prefer HTML, CSS, plain JavaScript, and Canvas 2D for simple 2D games. This is the default choice and needs no extra configuration.
2. **Track B - Local vendored library:** For one small browser library, pin its version and store it under `assets/vendor/`.
3. **Track C - npm + build tool:** Use npm and Vite only for Three.js, multiple ES Modules, loaders, or other complex dependency graphs.

### Three.js and Vite Rules
- Three.js is allowed when 3D is important to the designed experience; do not replace meaningful 3D interaction only to avoid npm.
- Pin dependency versions in `package.json` and preserve `package-lock.json`.
- Configure Vite with a relative base such as `base: './'` so built assets work under the Pages subpath.
- Run `npm run build`, then copy the verified static output into the repository root so GitHub Pages serves it.
- Add a `.gitignore` that excludes `node_modules`. Never commit `node_modules`.
- Record dependency names, exact versions, licenses, build command, and output directory in `README.md`.

### Expected Repository Structure
```text
repository/
├── index.html                 # Project home: designer statement, system graph, play link
├── game.html                  # Playable game (or game/index.html)
├── process.html               # Human-AI development timeline

└── source/                    # Track C only: src/, package.json, package-lock.json
```

## 12. Integrated Project Website Requirements
The website is the project space, not a final report and not a separate marketing page. It must exist from the first milestone and stay current as development progresses.

### Website From Day One
- Create the first version of `index.html` in the same pass as the first playable demo. Do not defer the website to the end of the project.
- The website is the exhibition surface: classmates and visitors will read it before or instead of playing, so it carries the designer statement, the system graph, and the play link.
- When the design changes, the website changes with it. A website that describes an older version of the game is worse than no website.

### Required Website Content
- **Game Idea:** project title, short concept, player goal, and core learning shift.
- **Domain Knowledge:** explain the real-world domain, novice misconception, expert judgment, and why this knowledge becomes playable.
- **System Design:** show the system graph and summarize environment data, player-controlled data, calculated results, feedback, success, failure, and challenge presets.
- **Development Process:** present a concise chronological timeline based on `agent-development-log.md`, including important changes, failures, tests, student decisions, and AI influence.
- **Play the Game:** the current playable version must be accessible from clear navigation and run directly in the website.

### Website Update Rules
- Create clear navigation among Home, Domain Knowledge / System Design, Development Process, and Play Game.
- Use only information supported by this brief, the system graph, the actual game, and the development log. Do not invent a smoother or more complete process.
- After every meaningful milestone, update the relevant website content and the development timeline.
- Keep the game idea and domain-learning explanation readable by classmates who have not seen the project before.
- Keep styling coherent across the informational pages and playable game, but prioritize clarity and function over decorative effects.
- Make the website usable on a typical student laptop. Mobile support is helpful but is not the first-version priority.
- Use relative links and asset paths. GitHub Pages serves the site from `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`, so root-absolute paths beginning with `/` will fail.
- Support a clean 1920×1080 exhibition view for display on an iMac. Important controls and text must fit without overlap.

## 13. Automatic Human-AI Development Log Protocol
In addition to building the website and game, maintain one Markdown file named `agent-development-log.md`. This file documents how the project develops through human-AI collaboration.

### Initialize the Log
At the beginning of development, create the file with:

```markdown
# Agent Development Log

- Project Title: Not specified yet.
- Student / Team: Not specified yet.
- Domain: boil an egg
- Core Learning Shift: from simply counting the time in mind or relying on users' feeling to observe how the water boils, how the egg moves and the sound of boiling
- Current Game Idea: this is a everyday thing. Most of the Chinese got a time when they need to boil an egg as breakfast
- AI Agent Used: Not specified yet.
- System Graph: add the image file or Canva link when available
- Development Period: add start and end dates
```

### Two Entry Types in One Timeline
Keep Raw Interaction Logs and Stage Reflections in chronological order in the same file. Do not separate them into two large sections.

#### A. Raw Interaction Log — Create Automatically
After every meaningful development interaction, append a short factual entry. A meaningful interaction includes implementation, debugging, code explanation that changes the project, mechanic or level changes, visual or audio changes, website updates, playtesting, or an AI suggestion that affects direction. Do not log casual clarification that produces no development change.

Use this format:

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## Interaction 01 — Raw Interaction Log

**Time:**
**Development Stage:**
**Current Goal:**

### Student Request
What the student asked the AI Agent to do.

### Agent Response Summary
What the Agent suggested, generated, explained, or changed.

### Development Action
What was actually implemented, modified, tested, or removed.

### Website Update
Which website section changed, or why no website update was needed.

### Files / Systems Changed
List files, mechanics, assets, data, UI, or challenge settings changed.

### Test and Immediate Result
What was tested and whether it worked, failed, partially worked, or remains uncertain.

### Student Decision / Follow-up
What the student accepted, rejected, modified, did not understand, or decided to try next.
```

#### B. Stage Reflection — Prompt the Student at Milestones
Do not fabricate student reflection. At a meaningful milestone—such as finishing the first playable loop, changing design direction, completing a challenge, or finishing a playtest stage—create a Reflection entry with factual fields, then explicitly ask the student to answer the Required Student Reflection.

Use this format:

```markdown
════════════════════════════════════
## Reflection 01 — Stage Reflection

**Time:**
**Covered Interactions:** Interaction 01–04
**Development Stage:**

### Goal of This Stage
### What Changed in the Playable Game and Website
### How AI Helped
### Student Decisions
### AI Influence on Design Direction
### Relationship to the Core Learning Shift
### Problems / Open Questions
### Next Step

### Required Student Reflection
Does the current game still help the player experience the intended domain-learning shift? What became stronger, weaker, or different? Which AI suggestion did you accept, reject, or change, and why?

> The AI Agent must ask the student to answer this section and must not answer it for them.
```

### Logging Rules
- Append new entries to the end of `agent-development-log.md` and continue Interaction and Reflection numbering.
- Be honest and specific. Record failures, partial results, misunderstandings, abandoned directions, and unresolved questions.
- Record when AI introduces a design direction, when the student rejects or modifies it, and when the student accepts code without fully understanding it.
- Separate factual development events from student reflection. Never invent student opinions or decisions.
- After milestone reflections, update the Development Process section of the website with a concise, truthful timeline summary.

## 14. GitHub Pages Exhibition

The exhibition is the published Pages site. No archive is packaged and nothing is uploaded to a shared drive.

### Enable GitHub Pages
1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. `Settings` -> `Pages`.
3. Under Build and deployment, set Source to `Deploy from a branch`.
4. Branch: `main`, Folder: `/ (root)`. Save.
5. Wait a few minutes, then open `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

Every later push to `main` republishes the site automatically.

### Pre-Publish Audit
- Run the project through a local static HTTP server and test every navigation link, the playable game, controls, challenge selection, success, failure, and restart.
- Confirm every internal link and asset path is relative. Root-absolute paths are the most common cause of a Pages site that loads but shows nothing.
- Test the layout at 1920x1080 for exhibition display; text, controls, canvas, and navigation must not overlap.
- Confirm `node_modules`, caches, temporary files, passwords, tokens, and API keys are not committed.
- Push, then open the live Pages URL and repeat the navigation and gameplay test.

### What the Student Submits
- The GitHub Pages URL: the playable exhibition link.
- The repository URL.
- Nothing else. The repository is already public, so there is no upload step.

### Public Display
- The repository and the published site are public, because GitHub Pages requires a public repository on the free plan.
- Anything the student does not want published simply stays out of the repository.
- The student must confirm before publishing that `brief.md`, `ratings.csv`, and `development-log/agent-development-log.md` may be publicly visible.

## 15. Instructions for the AI Agent

1. **Index the workspace before planning anything.** List every file in the project folder, then read `brief.md` and `system-graph.png`. Report what you found: which files exist, what the brief specifies, and what is missing or contradictory. Do not write code before this step.
2. Restate the core learning shift, core loop, main variables, feedback mappings, and challenge presets in a short implementation plan.
3. Identify missing or contradictory information. Ask only questions that block the first playable version.
4. Propose the repository structure, then create the website skeleton (`index.html`, `game.html`, `process.html`, `assets/`) and initialize `development-log/agent-development-log.md`.
5. Implement the smallest complete game loop first, then add the defined challenge presets.
6. Keep variable names clear, and keep environment data, player-controlled data, and calculated results visibly separated in the code.
7. Add short comments only where a high-school student needs help understanding a rule.
8. **The first milestone must ship the playable demo and the first version of `index.html` together.** Never let the website fall behind the game, and never leave the site to the end of the project.
9. Start a local static server, test navigation and gameplay, and give the student the local URL and simple controls.
10. Automatically append a Raw Interaction Log after meaningful development work, and request student reflection at milestones.
11. After every milestone, update the website so its Development Process page matches the actual log.
12. Before the exhibition, run the pre-publish audit and confirm the live GitHub Pages URL works.
